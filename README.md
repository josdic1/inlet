## The Problem

Job searching is chaos. You're juggling LinkedIn messages, cold emails, applications, networking events, and follow-ups across dozens of companies. Most people use sprawling spreadsheets that become unmanageable within weeks.

## The Solution

Inlet gives you one place to log everything with minimal friction:

- **Quick Add** — Log any activity in seconds with type, note, company, and link
- **Touch System** — When someone responds, hit "touch" to bump that thread to the top and track the conversation
- **Active Threads** — See exactly what's in motion and needs your attention
- **Filter Views** — Slice your activity by type (outreach, application, networking, content) or status (open, active, closed)

## Data Model

```javascript
{
  activities: [{
    id, type, note, link,
    personId, companyId, documentIds,
    status, created, touches: [{ date, note }]
  }],
  people: [{ id, name, role, companyId, link, notes }],
  companies: [{ id, name, tier, link, notes }],
  documents: [{ id, name, link, type }],
  values: [{ id, text, type }],  // type: "good" | "bad"
  resources: [{ id, name, link, lastEngaged, notes }]
}
```

## Key Patterns

**Context-Based State Management**
All data flows through a single AuthProvider that handles fetching, caching, and CRUD operations. Components consume via `useAuth()` hook.

**URL-Driven Filters**
Activity filters sync to URL params (`/?type=outreach&status=active`), making views shareable and bookmarkable.

**Touch Mechanic**
When someone responds to your outreach, the "touch" action:
1. Adds a timestamped note to the activity
2. Changes status to "active"
3. Bumps the item to the top of the feed
